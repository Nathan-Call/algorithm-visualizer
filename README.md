# algorithm-visualizer

This is a mini project involving a custom React web app that dynamically visualizes algorithms.

I wanted to build a mini project and challenge myself to build something with React that would simultaneously improve my understanding of common algorithms. I'm actively learning React so this project was a good stepping stone in my journey of learning how to integrate React into a tech stack.
